### Edit [23rd April 2021] : Poorna left the group on 21st April 2021 **
**We can see that Poorna was assigned the design rationale. Submitting the diagrams without a 
rationale would not make sense and would greatly decrease the comprehension of the diagrams. <br>
Thus, Amindu and Abhishek will complete the design rationale for the sake of the overall readability of
the design.
